This research used the open-source particle-in-cell code WarpX \url{https://github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx}.
Primary WarpX contributors are with LBNL, LLNL, CEA-LIDYL, SLAC, DESY, CERN, Helion Energy, and TAE Technologies.
We acknowledge all WarpX contributors.


ARTEMIS (Adaptive mesh Refinement Time-domain ElectrodynaMics Solver) is a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) implementation for Maxwell's equations that has been adapted to conditions found in microelectronic circuitry \url{https://ccse.lbl.gov/Research/Microelectronics/}
